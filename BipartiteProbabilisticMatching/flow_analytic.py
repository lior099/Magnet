"""
An algorithm for solving the matching problem, using the following algorithm:
Input: A weighted bipartite graph.

1. Let W be the ("full") weighted adjacency matrix of the bipartite graph.
   W will be normalized and represent a directed graph, such that for every vertex with output degree >= 1
   the sum of all weights of edges from it will be 1.
2. Let p be a vector of the amount of fluids held in each vertex. See the full statement of this problem in the
   documentation of the numeric solution.
   We will calculate the vector p that should be in a steady state:
   p = (1 - rho_0 - rho_1) ones_vector * ( (1-rho_0) I - rho_1 W) ^ -1

   Where rho_0, rho_1 are parameters of the model, ones_vector is a vector of ones, shaped as p,
   I is the identity matrix (of same dimensions as W) and ^ -1 means taking the inverse of the matrix.
3. Using p and W, we create a matrix of contributions, where the (i, j)-th element represents the amount of fluid that
   j receives from i per time unit, in the steady state.
4. The contributions matrix is normalized like in part 1, resulting the probabilities matrix.
   Here, we take the biadjacency matrix which is the upper right block for calculating the desired measurements.
   However, the entire (non-symmetric) matrix is calculated.
Output: The required probabilities matrix.


NOTE: The function "algorithm", which is the main function of this algorithm, receives a dictionary named 'params'
of the following parameters (e.g. {'rho_0': 0.1, ...}):
    rho_0 - Controls the amount of fluid we choose to keep in each vertex (rather than flow to its neighbors) per time
            unit.
    rho_1 - Controls the amount of fluid we choose to pass on the edges. (1 - rho_0 - rho_1) represents the amount of
            fluid per time unit added to each vertex.
